<strong>Neighborhood Association</strong>
<p>The Parkrose Heights Association of Neighbors (PHAN) appears to be defunct. You can still see its official page on the <a href="https://www.eastportland.org/PHAN">East Portland Community Office</a> website. Its Facebook page is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ParkroseHeights/">here</a>.  (Note: parkroseheights.org used to be the website for PHAN, but they let it lapse. This site is not affiliated with PHAN or any other organization).</p>
